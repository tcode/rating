InitPlayer -> Call with Points, Rounds, Rating in that order.
PWin -> Call with Player and opponents Rating.
PDraw -> Call with Player and opponents Rating.
PLoss -> Call with Player and opponents Rating.
All above functions returns a Player struct with updated information


==UPDATE==
Functions PWin PDraw PLoss are redesigned.
Now they do not take a Player in the arguments, 
instead you should call InitPlayer, which returns a player, you just need to supply a rating.
Now all the functions take just a float64 and calls like methods on the Player 'object'.
